# RTPBreakR

This tool is an old dirty hack only suitable for lab testing (if anything) and should not be used. At all.

## Requirements:

* ```ffmpeg``` or ```sox``` installed on the target system

## Usage
```
$ rtpbreakr (-r|-i) <source> [options]
```

### Example
```
$ ./rtpbreakr -r /path/to/some/rtp.pcap -d /tmp
```
